Kubernetes assignment work:
1. created a docker file for each frontend and backend
2. created a dockerhub public repo and pushed both the docker files in the repo . So that later we can pull them to create pods in kubernetes cluster.
3. Create a k3d cluster where we can set up our node
4. installed helm and creating a helm chart
5. making sure helm is running on K3d only
6. edditing the vaalues.yaml chart in helm such that it is able to pull the docker images from docker hub
